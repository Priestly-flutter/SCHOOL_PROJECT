This is my school project,
Created by Jato Priestly Njilah Njepnyu
Project for CSC214



This project is to be done in groups of 5, so far I got 3 members in the group.

This project aims at creating a website to be used by Regional Delegation For Secondary Education(RDSE) to manage the regional mock exams they organise yearly
The different type of exams that will be registered using this site are as follows:
GCE OL, GCE AL, BEPC, PROBATOIRE, BACCALAUREAT, CAPIEMP, CAPIET, CAP INDUSTRIAL,CAP TERTIARY, ITVE INDUSTRIAL, ITVE TERTIARY, ATVE INDUSTRIAL and ATVE
TERTIARY.Schools will henceforth register their candidates for these exams by filling
and submitting an online registration form.

#The will need to exist a separate registration form for each exam type.
#Each school is required to create an account before proceeding with its
registration.
#Payments are also done online after verification of the submitted
registration forms by an RDSE admin.
#The ADMIN is requred to verify a registration form.
#Verification consist of checking data entered through the forms if they are correct against a source (e.g. documents about school at
the RDSE).
#After verification and validation, a school should be able to print its registration forms (see extract of registration forms). At any given time.
#The admins should be able to view and print registration data per school, per division, per exams
type or for the entire region.
# Admins also have access to all data entered by the different schools. However, the operations carried out by an admin will be logged.

HTML and CSS

Task 3: Use PHP as the back end language in order to generate different pages as
required and connect to the database that will be created
